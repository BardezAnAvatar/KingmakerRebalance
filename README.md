# Call of the Wild

This is Pathfinder: Kingmaker mod.

It introduces new classes:  
- Hunter  with following archetypes: Divine Hunter, Forester and Feykiller,  
- Witch with with following archetypes: Ley Line Guardian, Hedge Witch and Hex Channeler,   
- Bloodrager with following archetypes: Metamagic Rager, Spelleater and Stellblood.

It also introduces 2 new feats related to these classes: Extra Hex and Rage Casting.


It also adds the following new spells:
- Plant Shape I, II and III,
-  Giant Form I and II,
-  Shapechange.  

Beast shape I - IV spells were also changed to be a bit more fun and more in line with pnp:
- Beast shape I allows to turn into leopard,  
- Beast shape II allows to turn into bear (without rend) and dire wolf (with trip),  
- Beast shape III allows to turn into large smilodon and Huge Mastodon (with trample),  
- Beast shape IV allows to turn into large hodag (with poison) and large winter wolf (with trip and breath weapon)  

The changes corresponding to these spells as well as Plant Shape I, II and III were also applied to druid wildshape ability.


In addition mod also makes some balance changes:
- nerfs animal compnions to make them closer to pnp (reduces physical prowess bonuses by factor of 2, natural ac bonuses by 1.5, and removes
enchanced attacks).
- sets base skill points of every classes to 1/2 of pnp value (since most skills in the game correspond to 2 skills in pnp),
- replaces favored enemy for Sacred huntsmater with animal focus as per pnp,
- fixes Magic Vestment spell to work as per pnp rules,  
- Legendary proportions increases size by only one category and changes Natural Armaor bonus to untyped (instead of enchancement).
